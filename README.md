# ML_Arena
Compare predictive modes &amp; predispositions to sway learning / evolutionary traits in an asteroids-like arena.

### Versions:
- Built in [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Libraries Required:
- [Arcade](http://arcade.academy/)
- [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)

### Usage:
- Clone this repository. `git clone https://github.com/McCrearyD/ML_Arena.git`
- To run any simulation, run `python3 -u main.py` inside the main directory.
- Follow the terminal instructions to run any type of simulation.
- To run all test assertions & test environment, run `python3 -u test.py` inside the main directory.

### Simulation Types:
- **Freeplay**: Freeplay allows you to create a single matchup using any type of pawn controller you'd like.
- **Evolution**: 
    - ***Adversarial***: Train a random (or load previous) population against another.
    - ***Other***: Train a random (or load previous) population against another pawn type (ie. dynamic or brainless).
- **Balance**: Run a balancing simulation for pawn statistical biases. Runs `x` match iterations concurrently and reports win/loss results for each bias.

### Indicators:
- Blue Pawn: If a pawn's color is blue, this means they have enabled their shield.
- Red Pawn: If they are red, this means their health is 0.
- Number Below Pawn: If a pawn has a number, this means they are a FitnessPawn. A fitness pawn is typically assigned to a neural network in order to judge how good they are. The higher = the better.
- Bar Above Pawn: Every pawn has a bar above their head that displays their health percentage. 
    - Green = +75%
    - Yellow = +50%
    - Red = -50%
- Red Laser: Long distance laser.
  - Lighter Red: Hasn't reached the minimum distance yet, if it collides with an enemy, they won't be damaged.
  - Darker Red: Fully charged laser, upon impact it will deal damage.
- Blue Laser: Short distance laser.
- Green Laser (Debug): A laser is highlighted green if it is the 'imminent laser' of the current player pawn.
